0.2.0 (2025-10-28)
------------------
### OMY Sim2Real Imitation Learning Pipeline
* Folder Structure Refactor:
    * Tasks are now separated and organized into two categories:
        * real_world_tasks – for real robot execution
        * simulator_tasks – for simulation environments
* Sim2Real Pipeline Implementation:
    * Task Recording: Added functionality to record demonstrations for the OMY plastic bottle pick-and-place task in simulation.
    * Sub-task Annotation: Introduced annotation tools for splitting demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, improving policy learning efficiency.
    * Action Representation Conversion: Converted control commands from joint-space to IK-based end-effector pose commands for better real-world transfer.

    * Dataset Conversion: Integrated data conversion to the LeRobot dataset format, enabling compatibility with LeRobot’s training framework.
* ROS 2 Integration:
    * Modified to receive the leader’s /joint_trajectory values using the robotis_dds_python library without any ROS 2 dependency.
